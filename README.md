# Personal Website 
This project is about my personal website, still a  early development.

This Website will be on constant change, as far I am learning new techniques I'll be adding to this project. 

## You will find the next content:
- About myself.
- Projects I have developed. 
- Activities I like to do.
- Contact information.
- Resume on pdf.

## HTML pages
All html pages are in the [sergiolopez.github.io/html/](https://github.com/Cherjios/sergiolopez.github.io/tree/master/html) directory. These are ejs files which call partials in ejs to include html in other pages.

## Static Files (CSS, Javascript)
All CSS pages are in the [sergiolopez.github.io/css/](https://github.com/Cherjios/sergiolopez.github.io/tree/master/css) directory. These are ejs files which call partials in ejs to include html in other pages.
